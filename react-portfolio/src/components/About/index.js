            I currently earning a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the University of Iowa and am planning to graduate in 2023. 
            I have experience using JavaScript and I have a lot of interest working as a front-end engineer one day. 
            I also have experience using React, Java, Python, C++, C, HTML/CSS and Git.

            In my free time I enjoy watching sports, playing basketball, and being outside.
            I aslo love making art and find myself often having art project ideas that I can't get out of my head until I try them.
            This includes lots of painting but also some woodworking.
          </p>
          <p>
            On this site you will find personal projects that I completed. Through trial and error, the internet and school, 
            creating these projects helped me understand concepts of computer science, languages and frameworks.
